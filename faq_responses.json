    "Can you elaborate on your experience with Geospatial Segmentation at Uber? Specifically, what were the key challenges you addressed, and what was the impact of leveraging H3 spatial indexing?": "In my role as Senior Data Scientist, I utilized H3 spatial indexing to partition multi-source datasets, enabling precise estimation of expansion opportunities. The key challenge was integrating diverse geo-information to create a cohesive view for strategic planning. The impact was significant; we gained a granular understanding of market potential, allowing us to identify and prioritize high-value areas for expansion, distinguishing between greenfield and competitive opportunities. This led to more informed decision-making for market strategies.",
    "Your resume mentions saving ~$6M annually through sales automation at Uber. Could you describe the technologies and methodologies you employed in developing the NLP-based entity resolution model?": "Certainly. To automate restaurant sales, I built an NLP-based entity resolution model using Python and various open-source libraries like spaCy and scikit-learn. The process involved data cleaning, feature engineering (including text embeddings), and model training. The model was trained on a large dataset of restaurant data to accurately resolve entities, such as restaurant names and locations. This helped streamline the sales process and minimize the manual effort required.",
    "You have a strong background in both data science and business intelligence, as evidenced by your experience at Vodafone and ProCons-4it. How do you approach bridging the gap between technical data analysis and business stakeholder needs, and can you provide an example from your work?": "I always make sure to start by deeply understanding the business requirements and pain points. At Vodafone, for instance, I collaborated closely with business stakeholders to democratize data insights and design A/B testing experiments. I focused on translating complex data into accessible reports and dashboards. For example, I developed key performance indicators (KPIs) that were directly aligned with business goals. This resulted in actionable insights for stakeholders and empowered them to make data-driven decisions and drive transformation initiatives."
